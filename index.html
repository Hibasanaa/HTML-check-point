<h3>whta is HTML? : </h3>

<p>Think of a document that you would create in a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. They usually consist of more than one style.

    They use different font sizes to indicate different sections of the text, like headers, body paragraphs, footers, table of contents, captions, and so on.
    
    Unlike humans who can simply look at a document and understand the difference between a heading and a paragraph, computers donâ€™t have that intuition. In order to correctly render a web page, it must be explicitly told what each piece of content is.
    
    So how exactly do we instruct the browser to display web content? This is where Hypertext Markup Language (or HTML for short) can come in handy.
    
    HTML is the language that most websites are written with. It is used to create web pages and ensure their functionality.</p>

    <h3>what we use HTML for? :</h3>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. <br>For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.</p>
